- This project involves the development of my personal website.

- I will be developing everything from the backend to the front end myself.

- The backend is mostly set up. I am using an EC2 instance with the domain name https://gsoulis.blog

- The EC2 instance uses a DNS server that I have configured using bind9, as well as an NGINX server.

- I have also used Certbot to enable HTTPS rather than just HTTP for secure connections.

- Lambda functions and CloudWatch events have been implemented to automate the server shutdown and bootup process.

  - This will occur daily from 12 PM PDT to 7 AM PDT to save costs.

- The site will feature all projects I have worked on that I have not yet posted or shared, as well as projects I am currently working on.

- Thank you, and I hope you enjoy your stay :D
