                This site was initially using github pages but is now being rebuilt from scratch. All code and services will be developed and configured by me.

                I'm a fourth-year Computer Science major with a minor in Computer Information Systems at Cal Poly Pomona. Currently, I'm working as an IT Support Technician for the City of Glendale and am learning new skills in cybersecurity, software engineering, and game development.     
            <p>
                My passion for offensive security has led me to compete in cybersecurity competitions, tackle HackTheBox challenges, and dive into malware development and analysis. I plan to document my journey and am working toward professional certifications. My current goals include earning the CompTIA Security+, Red Team Ops 1, and ultimately the OSCP where only those who try harder earn this certificate.
            </p> 
                My current projects include preparing for the CompTIA Security+ and Certified Red Team Operator exams, exploring DLL Injection, and studying malware analysis. 
                As I navigate my final year at university, I'm keen on engaging in extracurricular activities.

                I'm actively involved in a cybersecurity club called SWIFT and serve as a team captain in cyber competitions such as NCAE and Cyberforce, where we recently achieved first place in the blue-teamers category.

                Additionally, I contribute as a developer for the Bronco-Hacks club, focusing on the static aspects of the website. I intend to keep this blog updated with my latest projects and achievements and challenges.

                    Special thanks to Bill, Alex, Dylan, and SWIFT for introducing me to cybersecurity and giving me an opportunity to learn and grow further within this field.
